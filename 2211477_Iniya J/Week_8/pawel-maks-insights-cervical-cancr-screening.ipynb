    "These insights would be hard to reproduce using SQLite instance that is provided. \n",
    "We spent many days of calculation testing this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In the last 2 weeks or so we started to extract \"likelihood\" features.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We realized that there exists many interactions in the data but they were present \n",
    "only looking at the head tables. After the data was aggregated at a patient level \n",
    "those interactions were already lost so we worked on the solution to check which \n",
    "combinations of features gave the best results. This resulted in some interesting findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What exactly are those interactions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard technique to transform 1-N relations is use something like \"bag of diagnose codes\", \n",
    "\"bag of procedure codes\" (similar to bag of words approach known in Natural Language Processing).\n",
    "\n",
    "However when doing this transformation one loses some part of the information that was in the \n",
    "original data. For example: what if the `diagnosis code` response rates are changing on a monthly\n",
    "basis? Knowing that such relation exists means that one must extract combination of `diagnosis code` \n",
    "plus `diagnosis date`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why insights generated using interactions are very useful?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Because each feature calculated like this is very strong. In our opinion insights should not only\n",
    "be interesting to watch but also be powerful enough to be a replacement for a complex model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can notice that AUC that we got using a very small number of features is very strong. \n",

    "- diagnosis code\n",

    "- diagnosis.primary practitioner\n",
    "- diagnosis.primary practitioner + diagnosis code\n",
    "- diagnosis.diagnosis code + claim type + primary physician role\n",

    "To get AUC close to 0.93. In fact it probably means that no complicated model is necessary \n",
    "go reach a very high level of accuracy providing that you know which interactions in \n",
    "the head tables are useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why not all fields are present in the table?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We included only those features which improved the model. We tested all the single features and \n",

    "`diagnosis_code` and `primary_practitioner_id` is particulary strong. It improved the result\n",
    "by a full point in AUC.  Here we introduced it without `primary_practitioner_id`. \n",
    "We noted that even if we introduce `diagnosis_code` and `primary_practitioner_id` \n",
    "before introducing interaction between `diagnosis_code` and `primary_practitioner_id`\n",
    "it still improves the auc by 0.5 point.\n",
    "\n",
    "This indirectly proves that there is dependency between practitioners and diagnoses. \n",
    "Some practitioners during the diagnosis seem to overproduce screenings and some underproduce:\n",

    "`P(is_screener | primary_practitioner_id) * P(is_screener | diagnosis_code) ~= P(is_screener | primary_practitioner & diagnosis_code)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be used to target practitioners with low screening rates for particular diagnoses. \n",

    "a very strong predictor. This is \n",
    "\n",
    "Below you can see a chart with diagnosis code and claim type interaction averages. Especially \n",

    "**Insight 3. Interactions with patient features**\n",
    "\n",
    "We tested many interactions between patients and features above but it didn't result \n",

    "\n",
    "Over the period of 2008-2014 the screening rate for people having diagnoses/procedures in those\n",

    "mean that economic situation in the country can have a very big difference on screening rates\n",
    "especially with non-insured people. It can be explained also like this: when people lost jobs\n",
    "the number of people who paid for procedures with cash increased but they couldn't afford \n",
